# Modelling the COVID-19 pandemic in Illinois


# 1. Model overview

### 1.1 Compartmental model structure (emodl file)
A basic SEIR model was extended to include symptom status (asymptomatic, presymptomatic, mild and severe symptoms), hospitalization, critical illness, and deaths, while allowing to track detected and undetected cases separately. In the model, the susceptible population is exposed (infected) at a constant rate described by the transmission probability and contact rate with the infectious population. After latent period of few days, the exposed population becomes infectious and moves either to the asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic compartments. At the end of the incubation period pre-symptomatic population develops either mild or severe symptoms. Mild symptomatic cases recover at a similar rate as asymptomatic cases, while all severe symptomatic cases that ‘should’ need professional care move to the hospitalization compartment. Hospitalized cases either recover or develop critical illness and then recover, or die. Once recovered, we assume that the population stays immune throughout the simulation period. The asymptomatic presymptomatic, mild symptomatic, severe symptomatic infections, undetected hospitalized are the infectious compartments with reduced infectiousness for the detected sub-compartments due to self-isolation. We assume that hospitalized cases that are detected are not infectious.

Simulations run per [Emergency Medical Service Area (EMS)](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emsjuly2016small.pdf) and are aggregated for [restore regions](https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/restore-illinois-regional-dashboard), and for Illinois. As of the 22nd of July, the ['covid regions'](http://dph.illinois.gov/regionmetrics?regionID=1) are used. For simplicity, the term 'EMS' is kept in the modelling files. 

## 1.2. Model parameters
Most of the parameters are derived from literature, local hospital data as well as doublechecked with other models used in Illinois (i.e. [UChicago](https://github.com/cobeylab/covid_IL/tree/master/Parameters)).
The starting date, intervention effect size, and the transmission parameter "Ki"are fitted to death data.

### 1.2.1 'reaction paramaters'
All the parameters are sampled from a uniform distribution as specified in the [experiment config (yaml) file ](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/experiment_configs/extendedcobey_200428.yaml#L43)

### 1.2.3  time-varying parameters (intervention scenarios)
The [time-event](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/model-file.html?searchText=time-event) option in cms allows to change a paramter at a given time point (days) (which will stay constant afterwards if not resetted using a stop time-event).
Time-event are used to define reduction in the transmission rate, reflecting a decrease in contact rates due to social distancing interventions (i.e. stay-at-home order). 
The time event can also be used to reflect increasing testing rates by increasing the detection of cases (i.e. dSym and dSys for increased testing at health facilities, or dAs and dSym for contact tracing)

Current scenarios include:
- No stay-at-home 
- Continued stay-at-home
- Stop stay-at-home order - immediately
- Stop stay-at-home order - step-wise 
- Contact tracing - immediately
- Contact tracing - step-wise

For details, see the [cms implementation in one of the emodl generators](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl_generators/emodl_generator_base.py#L514)

## 1.3. Model outcomes

Currently the model includes 28 compartments of wich 43 outcome variables are generated.
The outcome variables or channels, as referred to in the py plotters, are different aggregates of the main compartments by type (i.e. all detected, all severe symptomatic) and includes cumulative counts for the calculation of incidences during postprocessing. 
A ranking 'observeLevel' was introduced to select subsets of the outcomes. The primary outcomes are those required for the weekly deliverables, the secondary are the related outcomes that are not required for the standard outputs and tertiary are those that can easily be calculated outside the model, such as prevalence, or outcomes rarely used such as infectiousness by symptomatic type and detection level.

## 1.4. Age and spatial model structures

### 1.4.1. Age-structured model 
The "age_model" duplicates each compartment of the simple or the extended model for n age groups. To allow the age groups to get in contact with each other at different rates, the Ki (contact rate * probability of transmission) needs to be specified for a all age-combinations. 

-  Age groups: "0to9", "10to19", "20to29", "30to39", "40to49", "50to59", "60to69", "70to100" 
[(emodl)](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl/extendedmodel_age8.emodl)
To generate or modify the emodl files use the [age specific emodl generator](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl_generators/emodl_generator_cobey_contact_mix.py) 

#### Contact matrix
The contacts between age groups were previously extracted for running an [EMOD model](https://idmod.org/documentation) from [Prem et al 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697). [Script that extracts the contact matrix values](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/age_model/age_contact/age_matrix_reducer.py). 

### 1.4.2. Spatial model
The "spatial_model" uses a special syntax as described [here](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/create-spatial-model.html?searchText=spatial). 
To generate or modify the emodl files use the [locale specific emmodl generator](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl_generators/locale_emodl_generator_extendedModel.py )
- View the [EMS specific emodl](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl/extendedmodel_EMS.emodl)

#### Movement between areas
[...]

### 1.4.3. Spatial age-structured model
A test verion is available under [emodl file](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl/extendedmodel_agelocale_scen3.emodl).
To generate or modify the emodl files use the [locale-age specific emmodl generator](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl_generators/extended_cobey_age_locale_emodl_generator.py )


# 2. Software used
The [Compartmental Modeling Software (CMS)](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/index.html) is used to simulate the COVID-19 transmission and disease progression. The CMS language defines 5 main type: species, observations, reactions, parameters and functions, in addition time-events can be added as well as state-events. Multiple compartments, called ‘species’ can be defined. The movement of populations between compartments is called reaction. The model runs with different solvers, including spatial solvers. The model is written in ['emodl' files](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/input-files.html) and model configurations are written in ['cfg' files](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/input-files.html). The output is written into [trajectories.csv files](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/output.html?searchText=output).

The latest model description in emodl format is written in the [extendedmodel.emodl](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl/extendedmodel.emodl) file (note original emodl with history in [extendedmodel_cobey.emodl](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl/extendedmodel_cobey.emodl). 

## 2.1 Run simulations 
The [runScenarios.py](runScenarios.py) is used to run multiple simulations
given a configuration file with the parameters. The script builds off
a default configuration file [extendedcobey.yaml](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/experiment_configs/extendedcobey_200428.yaml)
and substitutes parameters with the values/functions in the
user-provided configuration file using the `@param@` placeholder. Multiple trajectories.csv that are produced per single simulation are combined into a trajectoriesDat.csv, used for postprocessing and plotting.


## 2.2 [Configuration file](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/tree/master/experiment_configs):
The configuration file is in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format and is divided into 5
blocks: `experiment_setup_parameters`,
`fixed_parameters_region_specific`, `fixed_parameters_global`,
`sampled_parameters`, `fitted_parameters`. The sampled parameters need
the sampling function as well as the arguments to pass into that
function (`function_kwargs`). Currently, only a few
sampling/calculation functions are supported. More can be added by
allowing for more libraries in `generateParameterSamples` of [runScenarios.py](runScenarios.py).

Note that the user-supplied configuration file is used to provide
*additional* or *updated* parameters from the base configuration file.

## 2.3 Inputs:
- Master configuration: YAML file that defines the parameter input values for the model (if not specified uses the default `extendedcobey_200428.yaml`)
- Running location: Where the simulation is being run (either `Local`
  or `NUCLUSTER`)
- Region: The region of interest. (e.g. `EMS_1`, or `IL` for all EMS 1-11 inclued in the same model)
- Configuration file: The configuration file with the parameters to
  use for the simulation. If a parameter is not provided, the value in
  the default configuration will be used. (e.g. [sample_experiment.yaml](sample_experiment.yaml))
- Emodl template (optional): The template emodl file to substitute in
  parameter values. The default is [extendedmodel.emodl](extendedmodel.emodl). emodl
  files are in the `./emodl` directory.
- cfg template (optional): The default cfg file uses the [Tau leaping](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/tau-leaping.html) solver (recommended B solver).
- Suffix for experiment name added as name_suffix (optional): The template emodl file to substitute in
  parameter values. The default is test_randomnumber (e.g. `20200417_EMS_10_test_rn29`)
  
## 2.4 Usage examples:
- Using the default emodl template: `python runScenarios.py
  --running_location Local --region IL  --experiment_config sample_experiment.yaml`
- Using a different emodl template: `python runScenarios.py
  --running_location Local  --region IL  --experiment_config sample_experiment.yaml --emodl_template simplemodel_testing.emodl`
- Specifying experiment name suffix and changing running_location : `python runScenarios.py
  --running_location NUCLUSTER --region IL --experiment_config sample_experiment.yaml --emodl_template simplemodel_testing.emodl --name_suffix "testrun_userinitials"`
- Specifiying cms configuration file and solver:`python runScenarios.py
  --running_location Local --region IL  --experiment_config sample_experiment.yaml --emodl_template simplemodel_testing.emodl --cfg_template model_Tau.cfg`
- Specifiying master configuration file and using short form of arguments:`python runScenarios.py 
  -mc config_param_delay7.yaml -rl Local -r IL -c spatial_EMS_experiment.yaml -e extendedmodel_EMS_criticaldet_triggeredrollbackdelay.emodl -cfg model_B.cfg

## 2.5 Sampled parameters 
As described in 2.1. and 2.2 parameters are sampled from the base configuration files when running `python runScenarios.py`.
The [sample_parameters.py](sample_parameters.py) script handles only the sampled_parameters.csv, it allows to: 
(1) generate csv file from configuration files without running simulations
(2) load and modify an existing sampled_parameters.csv (change or add single or multiple parameter) (default location `experiment_configs\input_csv`)
(3) it currently does not allow for generating new parameter combination (in process).

Running examples: 
- nsamples: optional, if specified if overwrites the nsamples in the base configuration, if loading an existing csv the first n samples will be selected (i.e. when selecting samples from an excisting csv file, could be modified to be random if needed)
- emodl_template: the emodl template is required to test whether the parameter csv table includes all required parameters defined in the desired emodl file to run
- example1: `python sample_parameters.py -rl Local -r 'IL' --experiment_config 'spatial_EMS_experiment.yaml' --emodl_template 'extendedmodel_EMS.emodl'  -save "sampled_parameters.csv"`
- example2: `python sample_parameters.py -rl Local -save "sampled_parameters_1000.csv" --nsamples "1000"`
- example3: `python sample_parameters.py -rl Local -load "sampled_parameters_1000.csv" -save "sampled_parameters_1000_v2.csv"  --param_dic  {\"capacity_multiplier\":\"0.5\"} `

When running simulations with an pre-existing csv file, specify 
- `--load_sample_parameters` (boolean) and 
- `--sample_csv` (name of csv file in `experiment_configs\input_csv` ).

Note: except the loaded "sampled_parameters.csv" and "sampled_parameters_1000.csv", csv files should not be added to version control on git. 

## 3.5 Define age or region specific inputs 
The [simulation_submission_template.txt](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/simulation_submission_template.txt) shows example command lines and scenarios that are currently being used. 

### Region specific sample parameters (i.e. using estimates parameters per EMS regions)
- [`EMSspecific_sample_parameters.yaml`](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/experiment_configs/EMSspecific_sample_parameters.yaml)

###  Age extension and age specific parameters 
- `sample_age4grp_experiment.yaml `(https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/experiment_configs/sample_age4grp_experiment.yaml) 
Note: this extension works for any sub-group as it duplicates the parameter names for the defined group names, which need to be defined in the same way in the corresponding emodl file.

## 3.6. Local environment setup
Use a `.env` file in the same directory as your `runScenarios` script to define paths to directories and files on your own computer.
Copy the `sample.env` file to `.env` and edit so that paths point as needed for your system.

## 3.7. Running on OS X or Linux
The CMS software is provided as a compiled Windows executable, but can be run on Unix-like systems via [`wine`](https://www.winehq.org/).
If you do not have `wine` installed on your system, you can use the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile), which has `wine` baked in.
To build the Docker image, run `docker build -t cms`. Set `DOCKER_IMAGE=cms` in your environment or your `.env` file to use it.

## 3.8 Running on Quest (NUCLUSTER) 
A cloned version of the git repository can be found under `/projects/p30781/covidproject/covid-chicago/`.

### Requirements on quest 
All the modules need to be installed on the personal quest environment 
- use pip install ... in your terminal 
- install `dotenv` and `yamlordereddictloader`
`conda create --name dotenv-py37 -c conda-forge python-yamlordereddictloader python=3.7 --yes`
`source activate dotenv-py37`
`conda install -c conda-forge yamlordereddictloader`

The `source activate dotenv-py37` needs to be run before runnung the `runScenarios.py`

### Submit job 
`cd /projects/p30781/covidproject/covid-chicago/`
`python runScenarios.py --running_location NUCLUSTER --region EMS_11 --experiment_config extendedcobey_200428.yaml --emodl_template extendedmodel.emodl --name_suffix "quest_run_<your initial>"`

The experiments will go to the _temp folder on the quest gitrepository. To avoid confusion on owner of the simulations it is recommended to include the initials in the experiment name using the name_suffix argument

Next step copy the content of the submit_runSimulations.sh (should be a simple txt file) to the terminal to run:
- `cd /projects/p30781/covidproject/covid-chicago/_temp/<exp_name>/trajectories/`
- `dos2unix runSimulations.sh`  # converts windows format to linux format
- `sbatch runSimulations.sh`  # submits the simulations as an array job , note maximum array <5000 scenarios. 

# 4 Visualizing and analyzing simulation outputs
Via the `--post_process` argument in the runScenarios command plotting processes can be directly attached to after simulations finished.
A sample plot is produced automatically, can be disabled via --noSamplePlot.
Even if no postprocess is specified, default batch files are generated for data comparison, process for civis steps and basic plotter (age, locale emodl).
Additional batch files or postprocesses can be linked to runScenarios of needed, otherwise the [plotters folder](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/) provides a range of python files that do different visualizations (see readme in folder for details).
