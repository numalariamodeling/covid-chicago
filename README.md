# 1. Model overview

### 1.1 Compartmental model structure (emodl file)
A basic SEIR model was extended to include symptom status (asymptomatic, presymptomatic, mild and severe symptoms), hospitalization, critical illness, and deaths, while allowing to track detected and undetected cases separately. In the model, the susceptible population is exposed (infected) at a constant rate described by the transmission probability and contact rate with the infectious population. After latent period of few days, the exposed population becomes infectious and moves either to the asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic compartments. At the end of the incubation period pre-symptomatic population develops either mild or severe symptoms. Mild symptomatic cases recover at a similar rate as asymptomatic cases, while all severe symptomatic cases that ‘should’ need professional care move to the hospitalization compartment. Hospitalized cases either recover or develop critical illness and then recover, or die. Once recovered, we assume that the population stays immune throughout the simulation period. The asymptomatic presymptomatic, mild symptomatic, severe symptomatic infections, undetected hospitalized are the infectious compartments with reduced infectiousness for the detected sub-compartments due to self-isolation. We assume that hospitalized cases that are detected are not infectious.

Simulations run per [Emergency Medical Service Area (EMS)](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emsjuly2016small.pdf) and are aggregated for [restore regions](https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/restore-illinois-regional-dashboard), and for Illinois. As of the 22nd of July, the ['covid regions'](http://dph.illinois.gov/regionmetrics?regionID=1) are used. For simplicity, the term 'EMS' is kept in the modelling files. 

## 1.2. Model parameters
Most of the parameters are derived from literature, local hospital data as well as doublechecked with other models used in Illinois (i.e. [UChicago](https://github.com/cobeylab/covid_IL/tree/master/Parameters)).
The starting date, intervention effect size, and the transmission parameter "Ki"are fitted to death data.

### 1.2.3  time-varying parameters (intervention scenarios)
The [time-event](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/model-file.html?searchText=time-event) option in cms allows to change a paramter at a given time point (days) (which will stay constant afterwards if not resetted using a stop time-event).
Time-event are used to define reduction in the transmission rate, reflecting a decrease in contact rates due to social distancing interventions (i.e. stay-at-home order). 
The time event can also be used to reflect increasing testing rates by increasing the detection of cases (i.e. dSym and dSys for increased testing at health facilities, or dAs and dSym for contact tracing)

Current scenarios include:
- No stay-at-home 
- Continued stay-at-home
- Stop stay-at-home order - immediately
- Stop stay-at-home order - step-wise 
- Contact tracing - immediately
- Contact tracing - step-wise

## 1.3. Model outcomes

Currently the model includes 28 compartments of which 43 outcome variables are generated.
The outcome variables or channels, as referred to in the py plotters, are different aggregates of the main compartments by type (i.e. all detected, all severe symptomatic) and includes cumulative counts for the calculation of incidences during postprocessing. 
A ranking 'observeLevel' was introduced to select subsets of the outcomes. The primary outcomes are those required for the weekly deliverables, the secondary are the related outcomes that are not required for the standard outputs and tertiary are those that can easily be calculated outside the model, such as prevalence, or outcomes rarely used such as infectiousness by symptomatic type and detection level.

## 1.4. Age and spatial model structures

### 1.4.1. Age-structured model 
The "age_model" duplicates each compartment of the simple or the extended model for n age groups. To allow the age groups to get in contact with each other at different rates, the Ki (contact rate * probability of transmission) needs to be specified for a all age-combinations. 

-  Age groups: "0to9", "10to19", "20to29", "30to39", "40to49", "50to59", "60to69", "70to100" 
[(emodl)](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl/extendedmodel_age8.emodl)
To generate or modify the emodl files use the [age specific emodl generator](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl_generators/emodl_generator_cobey_contact_mix.py) 

#### Contact matrix
The contacts between age groups were previously extracted for running an [EMOD model](https://idmod.org/documentation) from [Prem et al 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697). [Script that extracts the contact matrix values](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/age_model/age_contact/age_matrix_reducer.py). 

### 1.4.2. Spatial model
The "spatial_model" uses a special syntax as described [here](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/create-spatial-model.html?searchText=spatial). 
To generate or modify the emodl files use the [locale specific emmodl generator](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl_generators/locale_emodl_generator_extendedModel.py )
- View the [EMS specific emodl](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl/extendedmodel_EMS.emodl)


### 1.4.3. Spatial age-structured model
A test verion is available under [emodl file](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl/extendedmodel_agelocale_scen3.emodl).
To generate or modify the emodl files use the [locale-age specific emmodl generator](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl_generators/extended_cobey_age_locale_emodl_generator.py )


# 2. Software used
The [Compartmental Modeling Software (CMS)](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/index.html) is used to simulate the COVID-19 transmission and disease progression. The CMS language defines 5 main type: species, observations, reactions, parameters and functions, in addition time-events can be added as well as state-events. Multiple compartments, called ‘species’ can be defined. The movement of populations between compartments is called reaction. The model runs with different solvers, including spatial solvers. The model is written in ['emodl' files](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/input-files.html) and model configurations are written in ['cfg' files](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/input-files.html). The output is written into [trajectories.csv files](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/output.html?searchText=output).

The latest model description in emodl format is written in the [extendedmodel.emodl](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl/extendedmodel.emodl) file (note original emodl with history in [extendedmodel_cobey.emodl](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/emodl/extendedmodel_cobey.emodl). 

## 2.1 Run simulations 
The [runScenarios.py](runScenarios.py) is used to run multiple simulations
given a configuration file with the parameters. The script builds off
a default configuration file [extendedcobey.yaml](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/experiment_configs/extendedcobey_200428.yaml)
and substitutes parameters with the values/functions in the
user-provided configuration file using the `@param@` placeholder. Multiple trajectories.csv that are produced per single simulation are combined into a trajectoriesDat.csv, used for postprocessing and plotting.

## 2.2 [Configuration file](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/tree/master/experiment_configs):
The configuration file is in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format and is divided into 5
blocks: `experiment_setup_parameters`,
`fixed_parameters_region_specific`, `fixed_parameters_global`,
`sampled_parameters`, `fitted_parameters`. The sampled parameters need
the sampling function as well as the arguments to pass into that
function (`function_kwargs`). Currently, only a few
sampling/calculation functions are supported. More can be added by
allowing for more libraries in `generateParameterSamples` of [runScenarios.py](runScenarios.py).

Note that the user-supplied configuration file is used to provide
*additional* or *updated* parameters from the base configuration file.

## 2.3 Inputs:
- Master configuration: YAML file that defines the parameter input values for the model (if not specified uses the default `extendedcobey_200428.yaml`)
- Running location: Where the simulation is being run (either `Local`
  or `NUCLUSTER`)
- Region: The region of interest. (e.g. `EMS_1`, or `IL` for all EMS 1-11 inclued in the same model)
- Configuration file: The configuration file with the parameters to
  use for the simulation. If a parameter is not provided, the value in
  the default configuration will be used. (e.g. [sample_experiment.yaml](sample_experiment.yaml))
- Emodl template (optional): The template emodl file to substitute in
  parameter values. The default is [extendedmodel.emodl](extendedmodel.emodl). emodl
  files are in the `./emodl` directory.
- cfg template (optional): The default cfg file uses the [Tau leaping](https://idmod.org/docs/cms/tau-leaping.html) solver (recommended B solver).
- Suffix for experiment name added as name_suffix (optional): The template emodl file to substitute in
  parameter values. The default is test_randomnumber (e.g. `20200417_EMS_10_test_rn29`)

### Region specific sample parameters (i.e. using estimates parameters per regions)
- [`EMSspecific_sample_parameters.yaml`](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/experiment_configs/EMSspecific_sample_parameters.yaml)

###  Age extension and age specific parameters 
- `sample_age4grp_experiment.yaml `(https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/experiment_configs/sample_age4grp_experiment.yaml) 
Note: this extension works for any sub-group as it duplicates the parameter names for the defined group names, which need to be defined in the same way in the corresponding emodl file.

## 2.4 Sampled parameters 
As described in 2.1. and 2.2 parameters are sampled from the base configuration files when running `python runScenarios.py`.
The [sample_parameters.py](sample_parameters.py) script allows to: 
(1) generate csv file from configuration files without running simulations
(2) load and modify an existing sampled_parameters.csv (change or add single or multiple parameter) (default location `experiment_configs\input_csv`)
(3) replace single values for one or more parameter use python dictionary  `--param_dic  {\"capacity_multiplier\":\"0.5\"}`
(4) combine with multiple values for one or more parameters define additional csv file   `--csv_name_combo startdate_Ki_sets.csv`

<details><summary>Show examples</summary>
<p>  

Running examples:  
- nsamples: optional, if specified if overwrites the nsamples in the base configuration, if loading an existing csv the first n samples will be selected (i.e. when selecting samples from an excisting csv file, could be modified to be random if needed)
- emodl_template: the emodl template is required to test whether the parameter csv table includes all required parameters defined in the desired emodl file to run
- example 1: `python sample_parameters.py -rl Local -r IL --experiment_config spatial_EMS_experiment.yaml --emodl_template extendedmodel_EMS.emodl  -save sampled_parameters2.csv`
- example 2: `python sample_parameters.py -rl Local -save sampled_parameters_1000.csv --nsamples 1000`
- example 3: `python sample_parameters.py -rl Local -load sampled_parameters_1000.csv -save sampled_parameters_1000_v2.csv  --param_dic  {\"capacity_multiplier\":\"0.5\"} `
- example 4: `python sample_parameters.py   --csv_name_combo  sampled_parameters_sm7.csv   -save sampled_parameters_sm7_combo.csv`
   -(sampled_parameters_sm7.csv not under version control, but would for example include 10 values for social multiplier 7 for all 11 regions, the base sample parameters are repeated for each of the 10 rows of the additional csv)

When running simulations with an pre-existing csv file, specify 
- `--sample_csv` (name of csv file in `experiment_configs\input_csv` ).
Note: the specified csv will per default be renamed to "sampled_parameters.csv", hence the "sampled_parameters.csv" in input_csv is overwritten each time. A copy of the sample parameters can be retrieved from the simulation folder.

## 2.6. Setup 
Running simulation requires the CMS software and python. 
The model runs on Windows and Linux and on the computing cluster at Northwestern University ('Quest'). 
The detailes are described below. 

<details><summary>Show setup description</summary>
<p> 

### Software requirements and packages
The [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/requirements.txt) includes name and version of required python modules.

  
### Local environment setup  
Use a `.env` file in the same directory as your `runScenarios` script to define paths to directories and files on your own computer.
Copy the `sample.env` file to `.env` and edit so that paths point as needed for your system.

### Running on OS X or Linux
The CMS software is provided as a compiled Windows executable, but can be run on Unix-like systems via [`wine`](https://www.winehq.org/).
If you do not have `wine` installed on your system, you can use the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile), which has `wine` baked in.
To build the Docker image, run `docker build -t cms`. Set `DOCKER_IMAGE=cms` in your environment or your `.env` file to use it.

### Running on Quest (NUCLUSTER) 
A cloned version of the git repository can be found under `/projects/p30781/covidproject/covid-chicago/`.

Requirements:
All the modules need to be installed on the personal quest environment 
- use pip install ... in your terminal 
- install `dotenv` and `yamlordereddictloader`
`conda create --name dotenv-py37 -c conda-forge python-yamlordereddictloader python=3.7 --yes`
`source activate dotenv-py37`
`conda install -c conda-forge yamlordereddictloader`

Alternatively, a virtual environment can be activated using:
i.e. add a `set-covid-chicago` command in the `bash.profile` file in the home directory

	set-covid-chicago(){
		module purge all
		module load python/anaconda3.6
		source activate /projects/p30781/anaconda3/envs/team-test-py37
	}
  
[Box syncing](https://kb.northwestern.edu/page.php?id=70521):

	mirror-box-covid(){
		lftp -p 990 -u <useremail> ftps://box.com -e "mirror NU-malaria-team/data/covid_IDPH/Cleaned\ Data/ /projects/p30781/covidproject/data/covid_IDPH/Cleaned\ Data/; exit"
		lftp -p 990 -u <useremail> ftps://box.com -e "mirror NU-malaria-team/data/covid_IDPH/Corona\ virus\ reports/ /projects/p30781/covidproject/data/covid_IDPH/Corona\ virus\ reports/; exit"
		lftp -p 990 -u <useremail> ftps://box.com -e "mirror -R /projects/p30781/covidproject/projects/covid_chicago/cms_sim/simulation_output/ NU-malaria-team/projects/covid_chicago/cms_sim/simulation_output/; exit"
	}
 

##### Submit job 
On Quest jobs are submitted using the SLURM workload manager and syntax ([SLURM on quest](https://kb.northwestern.edu/page.php?id=89456))
`cd /projects/p30781/covidproject/covid-chicago/`
`- python runScenarios.py -rl NUCLUSTER --model "base" -r IL --scenario "baseline"  -n "userinitials"`

The experiments will go to the `_temp` folder on the quest gitrepository. 
To avoid confusion on owner of the simulations it is recommended to include the initials in the experiment name using the name_suffix argument

The status of the job submission can be called via `squeue -u <username>`

Further helpful examples are in the [readme in nucluster](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/tree/master/nucluster#submission-workflow-on-the-nu-cluster-quest)

# 3 Postprocessing and visualization of simulation outputs
Via the `--post_process` argument in the runScenarios command additional scripts will run directly after simulations finished.
Batch files are generated for data comparison, process for civis steps and basic plotter (age, locale emodl regardless of the  `--post_process` argument.
Batch files are only generated for the most important postprocessing files and additional batch files or postprocesses may be linked to runScenarios of needed. 
To see all the available postprocessing scripts, go to the [plotters folder](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/) (see readme in folder for details).
When adding the flag `--post_process "processForCivis"` in the `runScenarios.py` submission command, the batch files related to the weekly deliverables are automatically executed. 

## Postprocessing on local machine
Locally, there are two main batch files:
- `run_postprocess.bat` is a wrapper batch file that runs postprocessing files from the list below (general postprocessing not for weekly deliverables)
- `run_postprocess_for_civis.bat` is a wrapper batch file that runs postprocessing from the list below (postprocessing for weekly deliverables)

The postprocessing includes the following steps below:

<details><summary>Show postprocessing scripts</summary>
<p> 

- `0_runCombineAndTrimTrajectories.bat` calls  [combine_and_trim.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/combine_and_trim.py) combines and trims the simulation output csv files (trajectories.csv files) 
- `0_locale_age_postprocessing.bat` calls  [locale_age_postprocessing.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/locale_age_postprocessing.py) to plot trajectories for pre-specified outcome channels per age group.
- `1_runTraceSelection.bat`  calls [trace_selection.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/trace_selection.py) calculating the negative log-likelihood per simulated trajectory, used for thinning predictions and parameter estimation
(- `1_runSimulateTraces.bat`  calls [simulate_traces.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/simulate_traces) extracts fitting parameters,identified as parameters that vary (needs sample parameters to be fixed), and produces besttrace.csv and best_ntraces.csv, optionally starts a follow up simulations.)
- `2_runDataComparison.bat`  calls [data_comparison_spatial.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/data_comparison_spatial.py) comparing model predictions to data per region over time
- `3_runProcessTrajectories.bat`  calls [process_for_civis_EMSgrp.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/process_for_civis_EMSgrp.py) generates the result csv dataframe (i.e. nu_20201005.csv) and generates descriptive trajectories per channel and region
- `4_runRtEstimation.bat`  calls [estimate_Rt_forCivisOutputs.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/estimate_Rt_forCivisOutputs.py)  that  runs the Rt estimation, the Rt columns are added to the result csv dataframe (i.e. nu_20201005.csv), produces descriptive plots
- `5_runOverflowProbabilities.bat`  calls [overflow_probabilities.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/overflow_probabilities.py) calculates the probability of hospital overflow and produces the  (i.e. nu_hospitaloverflow_20201005.csv), also adds total number of beds [additional script](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/overflow_numbers.py)
- `6_runPrevalenceIFR.bat`  calls [plot_prevalence.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/plot_prevalence.py)
- `7_runICUnonICU.bat`  calls [plot_by_param_ICU_nonICU.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/plot_by_param_ICU_nonICU.py)
- `8_runHospICUDeathsForecast.bat`  calls  [hosp_icu_deaths_forecast_plotter.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/hosp_icu_deaths_forecast_plotter.py)
- `9_runCopyDeliverables.bat` calls [NUcivis_filecopy.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/NUcivis_filecopy.py) that generates the NU_civis_outputs subfolder and copies all relevant files and adds the changelog.txt. Note: the changelog.txt will need manual editing to reflect new changes per week. 
- `10_runIterationComparison.bat` calls [iteration_comparison.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/plotters/iteration_comparison.py) that  generates the iteration comparison plot (last 3 weeks)
- `11_runCleanUpAndZip.bat` calls [cleanup_and_zip_simFiles.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/nucluster/cleanup_and_zip_simFiles.py) to clean up simulations (deletes per default single trajectories !! and optinally zips and/or deletes simulation folder

ATTENTION-1: if `1_runTraceSelection.bat` was run and the output csv files are located in the experiment folder, all subsequent scripts and plotting scripts will per default filter the simulated trajectories, if not explicily set to False in the `load_sim_data` function call.
ATTENTION-2: 1_runSimulateTraces.bat only needed for parameter estimation!

## Postprocessing on the NU cluster 'Quest'
On Quest shell instead of batch files are generated for the same python files as shown above.
For a detailed descripton of the shell files and processing steps, expand below:

<details><summary>Detailed processing steps</summary>
<p> 

The time limit for each single simulation was set to 30 min per default.
Simulation run in the `_temp` folder (`/projects/p30781/covidproject/covid-chicago/_temp/`) in the git repository.
After all simulations ran, they are automatically combined and moved to the Box folder on Quest, located in 
`simulation_output` (`/projects/p30781/covidproject/projects/covid_chicago/cms_sim/simulation_output/`)

Wrapper shell script:
- `run_postprocessing.sh` runs automatically after simulation finish, it includes scripts from the list below.

Run from `/projects/p30781/covidproject/covid-chicago/_temp/<exp_name>`
- `0_runCombineAndTrimTrajectories.sh` 
- `0_cleanupSimulations.sh`  calls  [cleanup.py](https://github.com/numalariamodeling/covid-chicago/blob/master/nucluster/cleanup.py) and transfers files from temp to Box (on Quest)

Run from `/projects/p30781/covidproject/projects/covid_chicago/cms_sim/simulation_output/<exp_name>`
- `0_locale_age_postprocessing.sh`
- `1_runTraceSelection.sh` 
- (`1_runSimulateTraces.sh` )
- `2_runDataComparison.sh` 
- `3_runProcessTrajectories.sh`
- `4_runRtEstimation.sh`
